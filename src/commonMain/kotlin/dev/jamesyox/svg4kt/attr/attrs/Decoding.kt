/**
 * The decoding attribute, valid on <image> elements, provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform
 * image decoding along with rendering other content in a single presentation step that looks more "correct" (sync), or
 * render and present the other content first and then decode the image and present it later (async). In practice, async
 * means that the next paint does not wait for the image to decode.
 *
 * It is often difficult to perceive any noticeable effect when using decoding on static <image> elements. They'll
 * likely be initially rendered as empty images while the image files are fetched (either from the network or from the
 * cache) and then handled independently anyway, so the "syncing" of content updates is less apparent.
 * However, the blocking of rendering while decoding happens, while often quite small, can be measured — even if it
 * is difficult to observe with the human eye.
 *
 * Using different decoding types can result in more noticeable differences when dynamically inserting <image> elements
 * into the DOM via JavaScript — see
 * [SVGImageElement.decoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGImageElement/decoding) for more
 * details.
