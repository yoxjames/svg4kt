/**
 * The `text-anchor` attribute is used to align (start-, middle- or end-alignment) a string of pre-formatted text
 * or auto-wrapped text where the wrapping area is determined from the inline-size property relative to a given point.
 *
 * This attribute is not applicable to other types of auto-wrapped text. For those cases you should use
 * `text-align` (CSS). For multi-line text, the alignment takes place for each line.
 *
 * The [textAnchor] attribute is applied to each individual text chunk within a given [dev.jamesyox.svg4kt.tags.Text]
 * element. Each text chunk has an initial current text position, which represents the point in the user coordinate
 * system resulting from (depending on context) application of the x and y attributes on the
 * [dev.jamesyox.svg4kt.tags.Text] element, any [x] or [y] attribute values on a [dev.jamesyox.svg4kt.tags.Tspan]
 * element assigned explicitly to the first rendered character in a text chunk, or determination of the initial
 * current text position for a [dev.jamesyox.svg4kt.tags.textPath] element.
