/**
 * *The `stroke-miterlimit` attribute is a presentation attribute defining a limit on the ratio of the miter length to
 * the [strokeWidth] used to draw a miter join. When the limit is exceeded,
 * the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.
 *
 * When two line segments meet at a sharp angle and miter joins have been specified for [strokeLinejoin],
 * it is possible for the miter to extend far beyond the thickness of the line stroking the path. The [strokeMiterlimit]
 * ratio is used to define when the limit is exceeded, if so the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.
 *
 * The ratio of miter length (distance between the outer tip and the inner corner of the miter)
 * to stroke-width is directly related to the angle (theta) between the segments in user space by the formula:
 *
 * `stroke-miterlimit=miterLengthstroke-width=1sin(θ2)`
 *
 * For example, a miter limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for theta less than 90 degrees,
 * a limit of 4.0 converts them for theta less than approximately 29 degrees, and a limit of 10.0 converts
 * them for theta less than approximately 11.5 degrees.
