/**
 * The `keyPoints` attribute indicates the simple duration of an animation.
 *
 * This value defines a semicolon-separated list of floating point values between 0 and 1 and indicates how far
 * along the motion path the object shall move at the moment in time specified by corresponding keyTimes value.
 * The distance is calculated along the path specified by the path attribute. Each progress value in the list
 * corresponds to a value in the keyTimes attribute list.
 *
 * If a list of key points is specified, there must be exactly as many values in the keyPoints list as in the keyTimes
 * list.
 *
 * If there's a semicolon at the end of the value, optionally followed by white space, both the semicolon and the
 * trailing white space are ignored.
 *
 * If there are any errors in the value specification (i.e., bad values, too many or too few values),
 * then that's an error.
